# Project 6 - Ace the Interview 
**Timeline**: Two days  
**Tech**: React  
**Description**: App that loads random behavioral interview questions for you to practice with.     
**Contribution Type**: Personal project  
**Status**: On hiatus  
**Retrospective**: I was looking up behavioral interview questions to practice and stumbled upon a site that had a whole set of them, and I had recently learned how to make a web scraper using Python, so I went ahead and scraped that set of questions, whipped up a [backend](https://github.com/RococoCoding/ace-it-backend) and this frontend as a cute practice app. I have a beta version with webcam recording as well because one of the career coaches at school suggested recording yourself answering and then watching the video so you could critique yourself and work on improving your delivery. That was a suprisingly challenging process because I spent a night trying to figure out how to enable webcam recording natively and ended up using an npm install instead. Then I spent another night trying to set up SSL on localhost because the npm package required it due to privacy concerns with the webcam. 

Bug fixes:
  -question not loading on start

Features to be added:
  -get questions by category
