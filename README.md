# Project 6 - Ace the Interview 
**Timeline**: Two days  
**Tech**: React  
**Description**: App that loads random behavioral interview questions for you to practice with.     
**Contribution Type**: Personal project  
**Status**: On hiatus  
**Retrospective**: I was looking up behavioral interview questions to practice and stumbled upon a site that had a whole set of them, and I had recently learned how to make a web scraper using Python, so I went ahead and scraped that set of questions, whipped up a backend and this frontend as a cute practice app. I have a beta version with webcam recording as well because one of the career coaches at school suggested recording yourself answering and then watching the video so you could critique yourself and work on improving your delivery. 

Bug fixes:
  -question not loading on start

Features to be added:
  -get questions by category
  
Features in beta:
 -webcam recording and timer. Message me for access alicetchang // gmail
